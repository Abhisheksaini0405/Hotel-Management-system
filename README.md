# Hotel-Management-system
Overview:
This project aims to develop a basic Hospital Management System (HMS) using Python. The system will handle essential functionalities like patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor management, and basic reporting.

Dependencies:
Python (>= 3.6)
Tkinter (for GUI)
SQLite3 (for database)
Other libraries as needed (e.g., Pandas, NumPy for data analysis)
Features
Patient Registration: Add, edit, and delete patient information.
Appointment Scheduling: Schedule appointments for patients with doctors.
Doctor Management: Manage doctor profiles and availability.
Basic Reports: Generate reports on patient demographics, appointment statistics, etc.

How it Works:
The system uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface. The core functionalities are implemented in separate modules for better organization. Patient, doctor, and appointment data are stored in an SQLite database.

Limitations:
This is a basic implementation and lacks features like billing, inventory management, and advanced reporting.

Future Improvements:
Implement user roles (admin, doctor, receptionist)
Add features for billing, inventory management, and medical records.
Improve user interface and user experience.
Explore using other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) for larger datasets.
